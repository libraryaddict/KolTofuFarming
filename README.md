This is a script for Essential Tofu farming in Kingdom of Loathing.

```text
git checkout libraryaddict/TofuFarming release
```

The script has some basic configuration, but expects you to have several things setup. At the very least, you should be in Gel Noob path with all essential perms.

You should own the familiar Unspeakachu, this gives a chance of more "In your cups".

The combat macro will be set up automatically.

You are also expected to have three outfits created.

Farming. You need an Eldritch outfit at minimum. The rest is optional, but recommended a Garbage Sticker, Mafia Thumb Ring, Mr. Cheeng's Spectacles and Xiblaxian holo-wrist-puter

Voter. This must have a "I voted" sticker in the outfit.

Rollover. There's only one outfit that benefits from rollover, the "Gladiatorial Glad Rags"

You will also need to setup a mood "acidparade". You can either have your buffset already setup, or use the below.

```text
When I run low on Heart of Lavender, use 1 lavender candy heart
When I run low on Joyful Resolve, use 1 resolution: be happier
When I run low on Lantern-Charged, use 1 battery (lantern)
When I run low on Merry Smithsness, use 1 Flaskfull of Hollow
When I run low on The Ballad of Richie Thingfinder, use 1 recording of The Ballad of Richie Thingfinder
```

Finally, you will probably need to get a Jokester's Gun. Just for the free kill. And to raise your auto buy limit as sometimes the cheapest batteries are not that cheap.

You are also advised to pick up a monkey paw, this gives us 150 adventures of the effect we desire.
